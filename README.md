# S06P02 Set Data

This project is my solution in **VB** to the **Set Data** practice found in section 06 practice 02 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Practice Requirements

###### **Practice 2 - Set Data**

Create a workflow that fills in the fields of a website with organized data that will be taken from an Excel file provided herein. It contains the following data: CompanyName, RoleInCompany, Address, Email, FullName, PhoneNumber.

**Notes**:

- The first and last name has to be obtained form the full name column of the excel file.
- Use only anchor-based selectors for this exercise.

### Details

**Course:** UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation

**Section:** 06 Selectors

**Practice:** 02 Set Data

**Project Format:** Windows, VB

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShonHarsh/RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB

### Sample Output

```sh
05/07/2024 20:17:44 => [Debug] Debug started for file: Main
05/07/2024 20:17:45 => [Info] RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB execution started
05/07/2024 20:17:45 => [Info] RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB.Main.Begin;
05/07/2024 20:17:45 => [Debug] Audit: Using Web App. Browser: Firefox URL: http://www.rpachallenge.com/
05/07/2024 20:18:21 => [Info] RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB.Main.OperationCompleted; Records Processed: 10
05/07/2024 20:18:21 => [Info] RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB.Main.End;
05/07/2024 20:18:21 => [Info] RPADev-S06P02-SetData-VB execution ended in: 00:00:36
```

### Notes

The robot reads a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet produced in the previous practice.  It also uses Google Chrome.

Regarding the name field, the data scraped from the website in the previous section had some wonky text encoding or characters for the spaces.  This caused issues with the indexOf(" ") not matching.  I replaced the troublesome character with spaces in the source file.

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
